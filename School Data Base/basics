Project: Design a school system database in order to link teacher, students and classes. In order to be able to identify which teachers teach
which classes and which student are in which classes. 

**We want to first off start in a very simple and basic link between the teachers,the classes and the subjects. In order to do such we we will 
only need to know the id for each thing (CRN(=class ID), StudentID and TeacherID).






STUDENT:
STEP 1:
	*-CRN
	*-studentid
	
	
Step 2: 
	-GPA	

Step 3:
	-birth date
	-full time or not -- we will put this in a boolean-- 
	-name 
	- adresse
	

CLASS:
STEP 1:
	*-teacherid (add the teacher id if crn on teacher)
	-CRN
	*-student id (add the students id in here from CRN)
		
Step 2: 		
	-grades (GPA Only)

Step 3: 
	-average grade
	-lowest grade
	-credit hours
	
	
TEACHER: 
STEP 1:
	*-teacherid
	*-CRN	
	
Step 3: 
	-name
	-full time? 
	- adresse
